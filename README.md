## Development

To start developing in the project, run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

This will start a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Deployment

We've set up auto-deployment using netlify. Every push to the main branch will trigger a new deployment.
